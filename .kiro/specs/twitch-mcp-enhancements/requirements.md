# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature spec focuses on transforming the existing Twitch MCP server from a basic chat interaction tool into a comprehensive, AI-powered Twitch ecosystem integration platform. The current implementation provides foundational chat observation and message sending capabilities, but there's tremendous opportunity to leverage MCP's full capabilities (Resources, Tools, Prompts, and real-time notifications) combined with Twitch's broader API ecosystem.

The enhancements will create a scalable feature roadmap that starts with improved chat functionality but evolves into advanced capabilities including AI-powered community management, content creation assistance, cross-platform integration, real-time analytics, and personalized viewer experiences. This positions the MCP server as an essential tool for streamers, moderators, and developers working within the Twitch ecosystem.
